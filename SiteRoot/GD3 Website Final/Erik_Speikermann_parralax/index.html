                <p><span class="bold">Erik Spiekermann’s FF Meta</span> is the foundation of the FontFont library, released near the label’s inception and still a signature of the brand. Its ancestor—PT55—was conceived in <span class="bold">1985</span> for the West German Post Office (Deutsche Bundespost) as an economical typeface for use at small point sizes on cheap paper. But once FF Meta was released to the public it was used for nearly everything, quickly becoming one of the most popular typefaces of the computer era. It has been called the <span class="bold">“Helvetica of the ’90s”</span>—not because the two typefaces have anything aesthetically in common—but because FF Meta fulfills so well the needs of modern communication.</p>
                
                <p>A number of factors helped contribute to the success of FF Meta. It was one of the first digital typefaces to include oldstyle figures as standard. The letterforms in the typeface were distinctive, and stood apart from the competition. Features like the lowercase “g” helped font users learn to identify the typeface. And, last but not least, many world-class graphic designers put the typeface to good use—including Erik Spiekermann himself.</p>

            <div class="col2 meta white">
                
                <p>Over the 25 years since its inception, the FF Meta family has been extended to include eight weights and two widths, as well as additional companion families, like <span class="bold">FF Meta Headline, FF Meta Serif, and FF Meta Correspondence.</span> The original FF Meta typeface has extended to a very flexible superfamily, as fresh as it was when it was born.</p>
                
                <p>In 2011, the <span class="bold">Museum of Modern Art in New York</span> added digital typefaces to its permanent collection for the very first time. Naturally, because of its significance to typography, FF Meta was one of the works included. FF Meta debuted at MoMA as part of the “Standard Deviations” installation in the contemporary design gallery</p>

                <p>Of all his typefaces in the FontFont library, <span class="bold">FF Dax</span> is<br/> <span class="bold">Hans Reichel</span>’s magnum opus. FF Dax is a contemporary streamlined sans serif family family with three widths: normal, wide, and condensed. Curiously for a typeface family of this size, FF Dax Condensed was the first part of the family to be released, back in <span class="bold">1995.</span></p>
<p>
For <span class="bold">Hans Reichel</span> (1949–2011), the concept behind FF Dax was to combine the clarity of a narrow Futura with a more humanist touch. This created a space-saving and very legible typeface of timeless design. The typeface’s most obvious and influential characteristic is the lack of spurs in the d, g, m, n, p, q, r and u. After 1995, the family quickly grew to include the wider, but still narrow, FF Dax, followed by FF Dax Wide. And, in keeping with Reichel’s completist ways, all the widths are available in six weights: light, regular, medium, bold, extra bold, and black.

<span class="bold">Critique Magazine bestowed an award on FF Dax back in 1998.</span> In that year, it was one of just 4% of considered designs judged worthy enough for publication. But Critique Magazine hasn’t been the only fan of FF Dax: since its release in the late-1990s, the typeface has steadily been one of the FontFont library’s best selling families.</p>

                	<p>It’s always a challenge to give numbers space, because you need to create a complete set where each figure takes up the same amount of room: The 1 has to be as wide as the 0 so that when you make tables they arrange. It’s just another design challenge. I don’t do a lot of designing or drawing myself anymore because there are people who are much quicker than I am, but the numbers I always do myself because I like them so much, even though I probably spend way more time than I should. They’re just too pretty.</p>

The result is rather technical in appearance, and very contemporary in feeling. The family includes <span class="bold">18 variants: six weights, each delivered in three widths.</span> This versatility sets it apart from similar experiments.</p>
            
            <p>The first sketches of FF Mach were drawn in <span class="bold">2004</span>, when a colleague of Dziedzic’s planned a new Polish arts and culture magazine. He asked Dziedzic for a logo; there was neither time nor money, and Dziedzic created one for free. The logo was met with approval, and Dziedzic was asked for a few sample covers. A few days later, his colleague requested the whole layout, too. Again, for free. Dziedzic agreed with mixed feelings, thinking this might be a chance to put some of his typefaces to use, and even make a new one based on the logo and title graphics. </p>

        	<p>The result was the kernel of the FF Mach family. It worked rather well; unfortunately, however, the magazine failed three months later. The typeface fell into disuse until <span class="bold">Dziedzic redrew all the glyphs in 2008</span>, removing the traces of its speedy origin.</p>

                	<p>With numbers there are more restrictions, and there’s more freedom at the same time. You look at some typefaces and you wonder where the numbers came from. The truth is, they were probably added later. There is a sort of generic set of numbers that can always be integrated into almost any typeface. If you look at the Century School font, for example, that’s the sort of generic  especially American  typeface of the 1800s. It has a specific set of numbers, but you could put those same numbers into almost any other typeface and they wouldn’t look out of place because numbers have their own shapes, different from characters; they’re standing alone anyway. So there’s actually quite a bit of leeway because they only have to conform to each other. The weight has to be kind of the same: the 1 has to look like a 1; the 4 like a 4, but not necessarily like the A or the B. That’s the weird thing.</p>

<span class="bold">FF Ernestine</span> was born from the search for a versatile monolinear text typeface whose design could encompass seemingly opposite feelings. Its designer <span class="bold">Nina Stössinger</span> wanted to develop a solution that would feel warm, but also serious; slightly feminine, but not too swirly-girly – charming and sturdy at the same time. The typeface’s rather large x-height and wide, open shapes enable it to work well in small sizes. Ligatures, stylistic and contextual alternates, a selection of arrows, and two sizes of small caps enrich the fonts’ typographic palette.</p> 

<p>Stössinger first drew the Roman as a study project at the postgraduate Type Design program in Zürich. The typeface then took a multi-script turn: an Armenian extension was developed together with Hrant Papazian. FF Ernestine is the first typeface in the FontFont library to support Armenian. The “Pro” versions of the typeface include this glyph coverage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col2 ernestine italic white">
        	<p>FF Ernestine’s <span class="bold">Latin and Armenian base cuts</span> are relatively independent master designs, unified by color and apparent size, as well as by their similar typographic mood. Both are culturally authentic and specifically optimized for their respective script. The Latin Italic acts as a pivot in the family. It shares the vertical proportions of the Latin Roman, and the slant and serif structure of its Armenian sibling. This also has the effect that the Italics are only slightly slanted, and not very cursive in structure; they are differentiated from the Roman also by way of their narrower proportions, different serif structure, and slightly lighter weight. If you’d like to pair Armenian and Latin, the Italic is interesting as an especially close partner to pair with the Armenian. If you don’t, well, it’s the Italic – an Italic which, as it’s not so cursive or slanted as to be distracting, can be rather nice to read for extended passages of text as well.</p>

<p>Starting with the idea to develop a no-frills typeface with as little historical ballast as possible Daniel Utz designed <span class="bold">FF Netto:</span> He reduced the letter forms to their characteristic basic shapes and removed all dispensable details. He adjusted the stroke weight unobtrusively, keeping the geometric construction principle and thus optimizing legibility and balance of the typeface. His approach was awarded with a <span class="bold">Certificate of Excellence at the ISTD Awards in 2009.</span></p> 

<p>Besides the alphabet Daniel designed a whole range of icons and arrows – very useful for information and orientation systems. Weights and sizes have been carefully adjusted to be perfect for combinations with the text faces. By using the border elements you have plenty of options to arrange and group the pictograms.</p>
