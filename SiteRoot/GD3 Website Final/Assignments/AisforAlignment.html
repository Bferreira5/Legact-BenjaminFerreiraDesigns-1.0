    for <br />Alignment</h2></div>

<div id="text_container"><p>There are five basic ways of aligning text. The first is justified: all the lines are the same length and align both on the left and on the right. The second is flush left: the lines are of different lengths and align on the left and are ragged on the right. The third, flush right, is a similar arrangement, except now the lines align on the right and are ragged on the left. The fourth possibility is centered: the lines are of unequal lengths with both sides ragged. The fifth possibility is an asymmetrical arrangement with no predictable pattern in the placement of the lines. From <span class="titles">Designing with Type</span> by James Craig.</p>
