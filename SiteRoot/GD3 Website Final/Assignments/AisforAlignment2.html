        <p>There are five basic ways of aligning text. 
        The first is <span class="emphasis">justified</span>: all the lines are the same length and align both on the left and on the right. 
        The second is <span class="emphasis">flush left</span>: the lines are of different lengths and align on the left and are ragged on the right. 
        The third, <span class="emphasis">flush right</span>, is a similar arrangement, except now the lines align on the right and are ragged on the left. 
        The fourth possibility is <span class="emphasis">centered</span>: the lines are of unequal lengths with both sides ragged. 
        The fifth possibility is an <span class="emphasis">asymmetrical</span> arrangement with no predictable pattern in the placement of the lines. From <span class="titles">Designing with Type</span> by James Craig.</p>
