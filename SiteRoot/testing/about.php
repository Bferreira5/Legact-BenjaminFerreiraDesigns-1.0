                                            <p>You find yourself ready to launch a new product. Or maybe you need to reconect with your customers? Maybe you just need to stand out in see of compitition? Perhaps you just need a freshened up your brand?

So where do you start?

Well you could take a chance with a large agency. Pay an enourmous fee. Then realize that you were handed great eyecandy that has no impact on your customer base or fails to add any new leads.

or...

You could hire the local marketing firm to create a print and television campaign. Pay alot of fee. Then realize that print did not reach your target demographic, television did not communicate your service well, and your marketing budget has been drained without adding a single new customer.

then...

Some hotshot social media "expert" sells you an amazing social media campaign that claims to increase you customer engagment and open you up to new markets. Sounded to good to be true. Turned out it was. So now you have a great Twitter page, and pretty facebook page… and no followers and no customers.</p>

Your brand may be wallowing, fadding away from the landscape. Gone are the days of just putting up you sign and having a open for business sign. Even a website doesn't get you the traction you once were getting.

You do all the best practices you read on forbes and cnn money. You even bought all of the (insert marketing technique here) books. Read em all! Not a single thing worked. So whats the problem?</p>

This is easier said than done. Even with all of your social media, blog, landing pages and web sites connected to each other thru code and links, unless there is a strategy developed, no one will understand what your brand is trying to say.

Look to plan your message. Create community. Focus on creating seperate content strategies for each social media outlet you are using.

What are the biggest problems they are trying to solve?

What does he or she need most?
What information are they typically searching for?
What trends are influencing their business or personal success?
