                <p>FF Meta Erik Spiekermann’s FF Meta is the foundation of the FontFont library, released near the label’s inception and still a signature of the brand. Its ancestor—PT55—was conceived in 1985 for the West German Post Office (Deutsche Bundespost) as an economical typeface for use at small point sizes on cheap paper. But once FF Meta was released to the public it was used for nearly everything, quickly becoming one of the most popular typefaces of the computer era. It has been called the “Helvetica of the ’90s”—not because the two typefaces have anything aesthetically in common—but because FF Meta fulfills so well the needs of modern communication.</p>
                
                <p>A number of factors helped contribute to the success of FF Meta. It was one of the first digital typefaces to include oldstyle figures as standard. The letterforms in the typeface were distinctive, and stood apart from the competition. Features like the lowercase “g” helped font users learn to identify the typeface. And, last but not least, many world-class graphic designers put the typeface to good use—including Erik Spiekermann himself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col2 into">
                <p>Over the 25 years since its inception, the FF Meta family has been extended to include eight weights and two widths, as well as additional companion families, like FF Meta Headline, FF Meta Serif, and FF Meta Correspondence. The original FF Meta typeface has extended to a very flexible superfamily, as fresh as it was when it was born.</p>
                
                <p>In 2011, the Museum of Modern Art in New York added digital typefaces to its permanent collection for the very first time. Naturally, because of its significance to typography, FF Meta was one of the works included. FF Meta debuted at MoMA as part of the “Standard Deviations” installation in the contemporary design gallery</p>

                <p>Of all his typefaces in the FontFont library, FF Dax is Hans Reichel’s magnum opus. FF Dax is a contemporary streamlined sans serif family family with three widths: normal, wide, and condensed. Curiously for a typeface family of this size, FF Dax Condensed was the first part of the family to be released, back in 1995.</p>
                
                <p>For Hans Reichel (1949–2011), the concept behind FF Dax was to combine the clarity of a narrow Futura with a more humanist touch. This created a space-saving and very legible typeface of timeless design. The typeface’s most obvious and influential characteristic is the lack of spurs in the d, g, m, n, p, q, r and u. After 1995, the family quickly grew to include the wider, but still narrow, FF Dax, followed by FF Dax Wide. And, in keeping with Reichel’s completist ways, all the widths are available in six weights: light, regular, medium, bold, extra bold, and black.</p>

                <p>Critique Magazine bestowed an award on FF Dax back in 1998. In that year, it was one of just 4% of considered designs judged worthy enough for publication. But Critique Magazine hasn’t been the only fan of FF Dax: since its release in the late-1990s, the typeface has steadily been one of the FontFont library’s best selling families</p>

                <p>FF Mach is a large straight-line sans serif family from Łukasz Dziedzic. All of th curved lines have been replaced by straight lines, some of which are set at angles to each other. The result is rather technical in appearance, and very contemporary in feeling. The family includes 18 variants: six weights, each delivered in three widths. This versatility sets it apart from similar experiments.</p>
                
                <p>The first sketches of FF Mach were drawn in 2004, when a colleague of Dziedzic’s planned a new Polish arts and culture magazine. He asked Dziedzic for a logo; there was neither time nor money, and Dziedzic created one for free. The logo was met with approval, and Dziedzic was asked for a few sample covers. A few days later, his colleague requested the whole layout, too. Again, for free. Dziedzic agreed with mixed feelings, thinking this might be a chance to put some of his typefaces to use, and even make a new one based on the logo and title graphics. </p>

                <p>The result was the kernel of the FF Mach family. It worked rather well; unfortunately, however, the magazine failed three months later. The typeface fell into disuse until Dziedzic redrew all the glyphs in 2008, removing the traces of its speedy origin.</p>
